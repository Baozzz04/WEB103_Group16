## About

### Description and Purpose

The project aims to create an interactive website for users to purchased videos from their favorite celebrities, content creators, etc. The platform will serve for 3 main types of users: normal users, celebrities, and administrations. Normal users can sign up and log in to the website to see all of the interative videos that their favorite content creators have. Celebrities can upload their video through the website, make their own introduction, and chose which video they would have as private videos, so only subscribed users are permitted to watch the videos. Normal users are allowed to leave comments and reviews for the videos. Admin roles can manage all users and celebrities, and change the account type from user to celebrity if the person is a real celebrity. Admin also manage a healthy and fair space on Cameo Clone so that all users and celebrities can have a good time using the app!

Our platform allows you to order personalized video messages from your favorite celebrities, offering a unique and heartfelt way to connect with those you care about.
