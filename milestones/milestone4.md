## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

For this unit, we completed the main page, detail page, and the order page for the user. We all colaborated on most of the features and fixed a lot of minor bugs that appears on the code. We also implemented the video display on our webpage easier than we thought, as we thought that the feature is going to be harder, but turned out to be really easy.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

For this week, our code has a lot of bugs, and we need to do a lot of tests of the features completed. Additionally, we also need to restructure our backend schema to be more reasonable because some sudden variables need to be added to the backend schema.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

For this week, we completed all of the tasks in the milestone.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The admin functionality can be at risk because we have not prepared the wireframe or the plan for it. We plan that the admin feature can be an optional functionality because the other functionities are sufficient in our project already. However, the other features are pretty reasonable and can be done next week for the final presentation.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Balancing our final project with other coursework has been challenging, and we feel that additional support would greatly enhance our ability to succeed. Options like structured project time or a deadline extension would provide the flexibility needed to engage deeply with each phase.
